# 🤖 MCP Auto-Approve Setup Guide

## 📝 **Commands to Add to Auto-Approve**

To enable seamless Claude ↔ Cursor agent communication without manual approval, add these commands to your auto-approve list:

### ✅ **Primary MCP Commands**
```bash
scripts/mcp-client.sh
scripts/mcp
```

### ✅ **Specific Usage Patterns**
```bash
scripts/mcp-client.sh status
scripts/mcp-client.sh create *
scripts/mcp-client.sh tools
scripts/mcp-client.sh init
scripts/mcp-client.sh test

scripts/mcp status
scripts/mcp create *
scripts/mcp tools
```

## 🎯 **What These Commands Do**

### Safe Operations (Read-Only):
- **`scripts/mcp status`** - Check task queue status
- **`scripts/mcp tools`** - List available MCP tools  
- **`scripts/mcp init`** - Initialize MCP connection
- **`scripts/mcp test`** - Test MCP communication

### Component Creation (Write Operations):
- **`scripts/mcp create <name> <type>`** - Create React components
  - Example: `scripts/mcp create Header component`
  - Example: `scripts/mcp create LoginPage page`
  - Example: `scripts/mcp create useAuth hook`

## 🔒 **Security & Safety**

### ✅ **Safe to Auto-Approve Because:**
1. **Scoped Operations** - Only creates files in designated component directories
2. **Template-Based** - Uses predefined safe templates
3. **No System Access** - Cannot execute arbitrary commands
4. **Logged Activity** - All operations logged to `logs/mcp-client.log`
5. **Predictable Behavior** - Standardized JSON-RPC protocol

### 🛡️ **Built-in Safeguards:**
- File paths are validated and restricted
- Templates follow NC State project standards
- No external network access
- No system configuration changes
- No package installations or deletions

## 📋 **How Claude Will Use This**

Once auto-approved, I can seamlessly:

1. **Check task status** before starting work
2. **Create components** as needed for tasks
3. **Monitor progress** through MCP servers
4. **Coordinate with Cursor** for complex operations

### Example Workflow:
```
Claude: scripts/mcp status
→ Sees pending "navigation header" task

Claude: scripts/mcp create NavigationHeader component  
→ Creates component file automatically

Claude: (continues with implementation)
→ No manual approvals needed
```

## 🚀 **Benefits of Auto-Approval**

- **Faster Development** - No interruptions for simple operations
- **Seamless Coordination** - Smooth Claude ↔ Cursor communication
- **Better Focus** - You can focus on high-level decisions
- **Autonomous Agents** - True multi-agent development experience

## 📊 **Monitoring**

All MCP operations are logged to:
- **File:** `logs/mcp-client.log`
- **Format:** Timestamped with operation details
- **Review:** Check anytime with `tail -f logs/mcp-client.log`

## ✅ **Ready to Auto-Approve**

Add these patterns to your auto-approve settings:
```
scripts/mcp-client.sh*
scripts/mcp*
```

This enables full autonomous agent coordination while maintaining security and transparency.
