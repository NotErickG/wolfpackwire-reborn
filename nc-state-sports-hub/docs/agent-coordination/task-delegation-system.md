- Include rollback procedures for deployments
- Provide monitoring automation templates
```

## Emergency Procedures

### **Agent Overload Scenarios**

#### **When Multiple Agents Are Struggling**:
1. **Immediate**: Pause new task assignments
2. **Analyze**: Review common failure patterns
3. **Simplify**: Break all remaining tasks into smaller pieces
4. **Re-assign**: Distribute work based on agent strengths
5. **Document**: Record learnings to improve future assignments

#### **When Claude Code Budget Is Exhausted**:
1. **Stop**: No new Claude Code tasks until quota resets
2. **Batch**: Collect all escalation requests for next period
3. **Alternative**: Use manual problem-solving and documentation
4. **Plan**: Prioritize most critical architecture decisions for next period

This system ensures maximum development velocity while preserving Claude Code usage for the most valuable strategic and architectural decisions.
